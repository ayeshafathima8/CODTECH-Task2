# Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model for predictive analysis on a dataset with continuous target variables. The main objectives are:

1. Data Preparation Load and preprocess the dataset, then split it into training and testing sets to prevent overfitting and allow for model evaluation.

2. Model Training Train a linear regression model using the training dataset to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

3. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score, providing insight into the model's fit and predictive capability.

4.Prediction and Visualization: Make predictions on the test set and visualize results. This includes plotting the regression line on the training data and comparing actual vs. predicted values to gauge model accuracy visually.

This project is a basic yet comprehensive example of linear regression applied to real-world data, intended for beginners in data science or machine learning who are learning to work with regression models. 

Key Components:
*Simple Linear Regression Implementation
1.Train-Test Data Splitting
2.Model Evaluation Metrics (MSE and R²)
3.Visualization of Regression Line and Prediction Accuracy
